<p>
    We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This policy, together with our Terms and Condition sets out the basis on which any personal
    data we collect from you, or that you provide to us will be processed by us. We strictly adhere to the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and
    Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Protecting Your Security</strong>
</p>
<p>
    To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information
    supplied by you during the order process against appropriate third party databases. By continuing to use the website you accept these terms and conditions
    and accordingly consent to such checks being made. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit
    Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information for payment clearance, credit reference, order fulfilment, delivery, data analysis or customer
    support. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will be
    unaffected.
</p>
<p>
    We may need to disclose your personal data where we are under a legal duty to comply with any legal obligation or in order to enforce or apply our Terms
    and Conditions and other agreements. We may also need to disclose it to protect our rights, property or safety of our customers or others which includes
    exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Information We Collect &amp; How We Use It</strong>
</p>
<p>
    When you place an order, register on our website, provide a review of a product, use any online form on our website, respond to a survey, or enter a
    competition or promotion, we need to know your name and other information such as your postal address, email address, telephone number and your credit card
    number and expiry date or bank account details etc (which are your personal data).
</p>
<p>
    By submitting this information you consent to our use of the information in accordance with this Privacy Policy as amended from time to time. We gather
    this information to allow us to process your request. The relevant information is then used by us, our agents and sub-contractors to provide you with the
    service you have requested and to communicate with you on any matter relating to the provision of the service in general.
</p>
<p>
    We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website and our service
    and may provide such aggregate information to third parties. These statistics will not include information that can be used to identify any individual.
</p>
<p>
    We and our group companies may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our website or any special service or products which we
    think may be of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
    We may also want to provide you with related information from third parties, which we think, may be of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
    We may also provide your information to carefully selected third parties whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you.
</p>
<p>
    If, at any time, you wish to have your information removed from our active databases, please send an email entitled "REMOVE FROM DATABASE" to
    care@cspdetailing.com we will take steps to ensure that your preferences are updated or the information is deleted as soon as reasonably practicable.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our Use of Cookies, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and Other Information Gathering Technologies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the information we gather from the following technologies does not specify any specific individual and is used by us as statistical data
    only about our users browsing actions and patterns.
</p>
<p>
    We may collect information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file. This is a small text file implanted by our site on your hard disk or
    device when you visit our site which collects personal data about you. The cookie is then retrieved each time you visit our site, making it unnecessary to
    re-enter the registration details on each visit and enabling you to benefit from certain features. For example, a more personalised service, improvements
    to our site and the ability to store the contents of an electronic shopping basket between visits. Please note, our advertisers may also use cookies over
    which we have no control.
</p>
<p>
    We may also collect information about your computer, including your domain name, IP address, operating system, browser version, how long you stay on a
    page, the route you took to navigate through the pages and the website you visited prior to accessing our site.
</p>
<p>
    You can choose to refuse to accept our and /or third party cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of
    cookies. However, if you select this setting you will be unable to access certain parts of our site or place an order with us. Unless you have adjusted
    your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site. Modern browsers provide the ability to
    navigate the web privately by using "private browsing mode" or you can use a proxy server, which allows web users to see pages via a third party web
    server.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>How We Protect Your Information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We endeavour to protect the information you provide and have various security procedures in place. We store the information provided to us on our secure
    servers where it can only be read by authorised personnel. Any payment transactions are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. This protects
    your data while being sent over the internet from being intercepted and misused by third parties.
</p>
<p>
    When you access the secure pages of our site your browser will be provided with an electronic certificate confirming that you have accessed our site and
    all communications will be encrypted. When you create an online order, request or feedback that is then passed on to the relevant destination using the
    same level of encryption, this includes credit card verification. Firewalls are used to block unauthorised traffic to the servers and the actual servers
    are located in a secure location which can only be accessed by authorised personnel.
</p>
<p>
    Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this
    password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. We also recommend that you avoid using the same password for different online
    accounts.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Sale of Business</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the event that this business is sold or integrated with another business your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers'
    advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business so that they can continue to provide the service that we currently provide. We will
    require the purchaser to follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy or to give you at least 3 months' notice of any proposed changes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Links from this Site to Other Sites</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of
    these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these
    policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
</p>
<p>

    CSP may also send you text alerts. You can opt out of receiving those text alerts at any time. Data may be supplied to third party data processors to
    enable this service to be provided.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Changes</strong>

    If we change our Privacy Policy we will post the changes on this page and we may also place notices on other pages of the website so that you can at any
    time check our current policy. If we make any changes that may significantly affect the way we deal with your information, we will also email you to notify
