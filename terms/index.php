<p>
	TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF SALE
</p>
<p>
	PLEASE READ THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAREFULLY. WE DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO YOUR RIGHTS TO RETURN AND CANCELLATION IN CLAUSE 5 AND THE LIMITS TO OUR
	LIABILITY IN CLAUSE 6.
</p>
<p>
	1. Our Contract
</p>
<p>
	1.1. These Terms and Conditions govern the supply of goods sold by CSP Detailing of Westbrook Park Trading Estate, Trafford Park, Manchester, M17 1AY ("we"
	and "us") to the customer ("you") and constitute the entire and only agreement between us in relation thereto. 1.2. All orders placed by you are on the
	basis of these Terms and Conditions and are subject to acceptance by us by delivery of the goods to you at which point a legally binding contract is
	constituted between us.
</p>
<p>
	1.3. The processing of your payment and acknowledgment of your order does not constitute legal acceptance of your order.
</p>
<p>
	2. Ordering
</p>
<p>
	2.1 On our website, you may place an order to purchase a product advertised for sale by following the onscreen prompts after clicking on the item you wish
	to purchase. You will have an opportunity to check and correct any input errors in your order up until the point at which you place your order by clicking
	"Place order and pay" button on the checkout page.
</p>
<p>
	2.2 All orders placed by you, and purchases of goods by you from us, are subject to acceptance by us (as described in clause 1.2). We may choose not to
	accept your order or purchase for any reason and will not be liable to your or to anyone else in those circumstances.
</p>
<p>
	2.3 Where we accept your order, we have a legal duty to supply goods that are in conformity with these Terms and Conditions.
</p>
<p>
	3. Price &amp; Payment
</p>
<p>
	3.1 The price payable for the goods you order is as set out on our website at the time you place your order, plus any charges for delivery as advised to
	you.
</p>
<p>
	3.2 We reserve the right to update the price of goods, from time to time but we will confirm the prevailing price with you before accepting your order. We
	are not obliged to accept your order and may decline it or limit the order quantity of goods sold.
</p>
<p>
	3.3 Occasionally, we advertise goods at a promotional price; you must quote the relevant promotion code, otherwise you may be charged the full price.
</p>
<p>
	3.4 Occasionally an error may occur and goods may be incorrectly priced in which circumstances we will not be obliged to supply the goods at the incorrect
	price. We will (at our discretion) either cancel your order and refund the price you have paid or use reasonable endeavours to contact you and ask you
	whether you wish to continue with the order at the correct price. If we are unable to contact you or you do not wish to continue with the order at the
	correct price, we will cancel your order and refund the price you have paid.
</p>
<p>
	3.5 We must receive payment for the whole of the price of the goods you order, and any applicable charges for delivery, before your order can be processed
	unless we have agreed otherwise in advance in writing.
</p>
<p>
	3.6 For website orders, payment can be made by most major credit or debit cards, by completing the relevant details on the checkout page.
</p>
<p>
	3.7 By using a credit/debit card to pay for your order or purchase, you confirm that the card being used is yours or that you are authorised to use it.
</p>
<p>
	3.8 All credit/debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of the card refuses to authorise
	payment we will not accept your order or purchase, we will not be obliged to inform you of the reason for the refusal, and we will not be liable for the
	item not being delivered or provided to you. We are not responsible for the card issuer or bank charging the holder of the card as a result of our
	processing of your credit/debit card payment in accordance with your order or purchase.
</p>
<p>
	3.9 We recommend that you do not communicate your payment card details to anyone, including us, by email. Subject to clause 8.5, we cannot be responsible
	for any losses you may incur in transmitting information to us by internet link or by email. Any such loss shall be entirely your responsibility.
</p>
<p>
	3.10 If you are a trade customer, you may not withhold payment of any invoice or other amount due to us by reason of any right of set off or counterclaim,
	which you may have, or allege to have.
</p>
<p>
	3.11 We shall be entitled at all times to set off any debt or claim which we may have against you against any sums due from us to you.
</p>
<p>
	3.12 The format of our invoice and statements to you will solely be dictated by us and we will not enter into any variation of our format.
</p>
<p>
	3.13 Any "Was" price displayed on the website shows the item's previous selling price for a period of at least 30 days prior to the reduced price coming in
	to effect, unless otherwise stated.
</p>
<p>
	4. Delivery &amp; Title
</p>
<p>
	4.1 We aim to deliver the goods in accordance with your order usually within the stated delivery time (except in exceptional circumstances) but not more
	than 30 days after the day you place your order, unless otherwise agreed between you and us, subject to clause 5 and 11. In addition to your rights under
	clause 5 and 11, in the unlikely event that we do not make the goods available to you within 30 days of placing your order you will have the option of
	cancelling your order by notifying us accordingly prior to delivery.
</p>
<p>
	4.2 Before placing your order, please refer to the delivery options set out on our website to ensure that we can deliver to your address. A valid signature
	will be required on collection or delivery. In the unlikely event that you have not received all the goods within the stated delivery time, you must notify
	us immediately. You must not schedule or commence any installation work until after you have received your order and checked all the goods are suitable for
	your purposes and do not have any defects or missing parts.
</p>
<p>
	4.3 For reasons of health and safety and to avoid any property damages, items can only be delivered to the exterior of a ground floor location at the
	delivery address. You must therefore make your own arrangements at your own risk if the relevant item needs to be transported from the delivery location.
	We will not provide any unpacking, installation or fitting services upon delivery unless otherwise agreed by us.
</p>
<p>
	4.4 You must do all that you reasonably can to enable delivery to take place at the given time and place. If you delay delivery, or delivery fails because
	you have not taken appropriate steps, we will try to arrange for an alternative delivery date within 30 days of the failed delivery. If delivery fails as a
	result of circumstances within your reasonable control, the cost of any re-delivery shall be borne by you. If we are unable to arrange a date for
	re-delivery we may cancel your order and refund to you the price that you have paid for the goods, less the failed delivery costs.
</p>
<p>
	4.5 Without prejudice to Clause 4.4, upon delivery of the goods to you, the goods shall be at your risk. In spite of delivery having been made, ownership
	(also known as "title") in the goods shall not pass to you until you have paid the price for the goods in full and no other sums whatsoever shall be due to
	us from you. Until title in the goods passes from us, you shall: (i) not be entitled to use the goods; (ii) safely hold the goods for us; (iii) return the
	goods to us immediately if we ask you to; and (iv) be liable to us for any loss, damage or destruction of the goods. In addition, until title in the goods
	passes from us to you, you shall store the goods at your own cost separately from all other goods in your possession and marked in such a way that they are
	clearly identified as our property.
</p>
<p>
	5. Availability
</p>
<p>
	5.1 All goods are subject to availability. While we endeavour to hold sufficient stock to meet all orders and purchases, if we have insufficient stock to
	supply or deliver the goods ordered and paid for by you, we will attempt to contact you using the details you have provided to us to ask you how you wish
	to proceed. We may, at our discretion, process any part of the order which is available. Where goods are out of stock, we will refund you the price paid
	for such goods as soon as possible and in any case within 30 days or, in the case of an account customer, we may, in our absolute discretion, as soon as
	possible raise a credit to offset the amount invoiced to you.
</p>
<p>
	6. Cancellation &amp; Returns
</p>
<p>
	6.1 You may cancel your order by giving us notice of cancellation within 30 days of the date of delivery to you. Such notice may be given by phone, mail,
	fax or email using the contact details set out at clause 13.
</p>
<p>
	6.2 If you are cancelling because of any problem with the goods, please notify us of the problem at the time of cancellation. In relation to goods
	delivered to you, you may need to take delivery of the goods before you can cancel your order if the goods are placed into our delivery process before we
	receive your notice of cancellation. Where your order comprises multiple delivery shipments, the 30 day cancellation period for the goods in your order
	runs from the date of the delivery of the last shipment to you.
</p>
<p>
	6.3 You will lose your right to cancel after the expiry of the 30 day period referred to in clause 6.1 (this does not affect your rights if there is any
	problem with your goods).
</p>
<p>
	6.4 On cancellation for whatever reason, where you have received the goods you must return the goods to us (with the original packaging) without undue
	delay and in any event within 14 days after the day of the cancellation at your cost, unless we agree that you may dispose of them in which case please
	comply with the manufacturer's instructions before disposing of hazardous goods. You must return goods with all components and also any promotional items
	received (including free gifts) or discounted additional products. Where the goods are being returned because they are faulty, incorrect goods or because
	of unsuitable substitution by us, we will meet the cost of return but we ask that you allow us to nominate the carrier.
</p>
<p>
	6.5 Following cancellation, subject to clause 8.6 we will refund you the price paid for the cancelled order (or part of the order cancelled). Where you
	cancel the entire order, we will also refund the standard delivery charges (or an amount equal to the standard delivery charges if you elect to use a more
	expensive delivery method) paid. Where you cancel part of an order, we will not refund the delivery charges. We will pay the refund within 14 days after
	the day:
</p>
<p>
	a) You notified us to cancel your order, where you have not received the goods; or
</p>
<p>
	b) We receive the goods you returned to us, where you are in receipt of the goods; or
</p>
<p>
	c) You provide us with a proof of return for the goods, where you have returned the goods but we have not yet received them.
</p>
<p>
	6.6 We will refund you using the same means of payment as you used to pay for your order or purchase.
</p>
<p>
	6.7 We reserve the right to make a deduction from the amount of the refund for loss in value of the goods returned where the goods show signs of
	unreasonable use; for these purposes, unreasonable use includes handling the goods beyond what is necessary to establish the nature, characteristics and
	functioning of the goods. We may withhold any refund until we have received the goods or you have supplied proof of return for the goods.
</p>
<p>
	6.8 Your right of cancellation does not apply to goods that are cut or mixed to your requirements, made to measure , made to your specifications or clearly
	personalised (for example, made to order kitchen goods, mixed paint or embroidery goods). Your right to cancellation does not apply to goods which are not
	suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons (such as water pumps, toilets and macerators), if you have opened the product packaging
	after delivery or collection. Boilers which have had the product box/packaging opened cannot be returned for refund or credit.
</p>
<p>
	6.9 We will not accept any returns nor pay refunds in the event that the goods returned are returned as a result of normal "wear and tear" of the goods.
</p>
<p>
	7. Faulty Goods
</p>
<p>
	7.1 Where the goods are being returned because they are faulty or incorrect, we will meet the cost of return delivery but we ask that you allow us to
	nominate the carrier. Your right to return goods in these circumstances is not limited to the 30 day period in clause 6.1.
</p>
<p>
	7.2 Without prejudice to your right to cancel orders generally, if you have notified us of a problem with the goods within 30 days of delivery, we may at
	our option either offer to make good any shortage or non-delivery, replace or repair any goods that are damaged or defective upon delivery; or cancel the
	order (or part of the order affected) and refund to you the amount paid by you for the goods in question.
</p>
<p>
	7.3 If an item develops a fault after 30 days following delivery and where the manufacturer has provided a helpline, repair service or warranty, you should
	contact the manufacturer direct. If there is no such service or warranty with the product, in most instances we will either offer a repair or where this is
	not possible we will replace the item with the same or an equivalent item.
</p>
<p>

	person, to any other person, for the use or installation of any goods by you. Accordingly, if you are a trade customer, you hereby agree to hold us
	harmless from and indemnify us against any liability associated with, any claim or allegation that we are responsible for any failings in the installation
	or use of goods that we supply.
